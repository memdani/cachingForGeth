# RPC Cache Implementation for Go-Ethereum 

## Problem Statement
An implementation and benchmarking of various cache policies on the go ethereum implementation of a blockchain node in order to possibly improve read call reverts. 

## Methodology
1. Geth Node - Build from source
2. Setup Geth with Sepolia Testnet 
3. Create smart contracts to check for caching
4.
